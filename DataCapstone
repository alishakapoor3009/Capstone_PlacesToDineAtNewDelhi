2) Data

2.1 Source of Data

Foursquare API to select the number of restaurants and their locations in New Delhi. 
 Zomato API to fetch ratings and average price of the restaurants using my developer credentials.


I will first create a dataset thought the Foursquare API to explore several types of venues, such as ID, name, latitude, longitude, neighborhood, and distance (in meters) to Connaught place which is a hub for restaurants in Delhi.

And then I will use Zomato API to fetch price for two and ratings of the restaurants. My main intent for using Zomato API is to fetch the average price and ratings.


I will then create the combined data set which I would then use further for my analysis.


Using the Foursquare API


url = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}&ll={},{}&radius={}&limit={}'.format(
    CLIENT_ID, 
    CLIENT_SECRET, 
    VERSION, 
    CP_latitude, 
    CP_longitude, 
    radius, 
    LIMIT,
)




Using Zomato API


 url = ('https://developers.zomato.com/api/v2.1/search?q={}' + 
          '&start=0&count=1&lat={}&lon={}&sort=real_distance').format(row['name'], row['lat'], row['lng']
